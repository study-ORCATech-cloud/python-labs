## Key Learning Points

1. **Exception Handling**: 
   - The `try-except-finally` structure for handling exceptions
   - Catching specific exception types (`ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`, etc.)
   - Using the `finally` block for cleanup code that always executes

2. **Logging Setup**:
   - Configuring logging with `logging.basicConfig()`
   - Setting appropriate log levels and formats
   - Writing logs to a file

3. **Log Levels**:
   - DEBUG: Detailed information for troubleshooting
   - INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected
   - WARNING: Something unexpected happened, but not an error
   - ERROR: A more serious problem, some functionality may be affected
   - CRITICAL: A very serious error that might cause the program to fail

4. **Custom Exceptions**:
   - Creating custom exception classes
   - Raising exceptions with meaningful messages
   - Handling different exception types appropriately

## Best Practices

1. **Exception Handling**:
   - Catch specific exceptions rather than using bare `except` statements
   - Keep exception handling blocks small and focused
   - Include helpful error messages that describe what went wrong

2. **Logging**:
   - Use appropriate log levels based on the severity of the message
   - Include relevant context in log messages
   - Structure log formats to include timestamp, severity, and message

3. **Error Messages**:
   - Make error messages user-friendly and actionable
   - Log technical details for debugging, but show simplified messages to users
   - Include remediation steps when possible

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Log File Access**:
   - Problem: Permission errors when writing to log files
   - Solution: Ensure the application has write permissions to the directory

2. **Excessive Logging**:
   - Problem: Log files grow too large too quickly
   - Solution: Use appropriate log levels and implement log rotation

3. **Silent Failures**:
   - Problem: Exceptions are caught but not logged or reported
   - Solution: Always log exceptions, even if they're handled silently

4. **Exception Handling Scope**:
   - Problem: Try blocks that are too large make it hard to identify error sources
   - Solution: Keep try blocks as small as possible while still being functional

## Cleanup Procedures

After running the script, you may want to clean up the log file if it's no longer needed:

```python
import os

# Remove the log file
if os.path.exists("app.log"):
    os.remove("app.log")
    print("Removed app.log")
```

This cleanup is optional, as you might want to keep the logs for future reference.
