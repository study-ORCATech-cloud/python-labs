MyProject Package

This is a simple Python package created for LAB07 on virtual environments and packaging.
It demonstrates how to structure a basic reusable package.

# You can optionally import key functions here to make them directly available when
# importing the package. For example:
# from .core import say_hello

# This allows users to do: from myproject import say_hello
# Instead of: from myproject.core import say_hello
