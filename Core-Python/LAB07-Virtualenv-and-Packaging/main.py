LAB07 - Virtual Environments and Python Packaging

This lab teaches you how to organize your Python code into reusable packages
and manage dependencies with virtual environments. These skills are essential
for creating maintainable DevOps automation tools and ensuring consistent
environments across development and production.

Instructions:
1. Ensure you have a virtual environment activated
2. Install the required dependencies (requests library)
3. Complete the TODOs below to work with your custom package
"""

# TODO: 1. Import functions from your myproject package
# Import the say_hello function from your core module
# If you've set up package-level imports in __init__.py, you can also
# try importing directly from the package


# TODO: 2. Use the say_hello function from your package
# Call the function with a name (e.g., your name or "DevOps")
# and print the result


# TODO: 3. Import and use the requests library
# Make a simple HTTP request to a public API and display the results
# This demonstrates using an external dependency in your project

# TODO: 4. Use any additional functions you created in your package
# If you added more utility functions to your package, demonstrate them here


# Display success message
