# LAB04 - File Handling in Python

Reading from and writing to files is a fundamental skill for any Python developer or DevOps engineer. In this lab, you'll learn how to handle files effectively - a critical capability for processing logs, managing configuration data, manipulating text files, and automating data workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Open, read, and process text files using multiple techniques
- Create new files and write data to them
- Append content to existing files
- Use `with` blocks to safely manage file resources
- Handle common file errors with try-except blocks
- Process files line by line for efficient memory usage
- Work with structured data formats like CSV

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Completion of LAB03 (Functions and Modules)
- Python 3.8+ installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Python syntax, data types, and control flow
- A code editor (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)

├── main.py                # Python script with TODOs to implement
├── input.txt              # Sample input file for reading operations
├── README.md              # This file with instructions

```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate to the lab folder:
```bash
cd Core-Python/LAB04-File-Handling/
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Open `main.py` in your code editor and follow the TODO comments.

---

## ✍️ Your Task

Open the `main.py` file and complete all the TODOs to learn about file handling:

1. Reading from a file:
   - Use a `with` block to safely open `input.txt` in read mode
   - Read the entire content of the file
   - Print the content with a descriptive header

2. Writing to a new file:
   - Use a `with` block to open `output.txt` in write mode (`'w'`)
   - Write several lines of text to the file
   - Note that this will create a new file or overwrite an existing one

3. Appending to a file:
   - Use a `with` block to open `output.txt` in append mode (`'a'`)
   - Add additional lines of text to the file
   - Verify that the original content is preserved

4. Handling file errors:
   - Implement a try-except block to catch `FileNotFoundError`
   - Attempt to open a non-existent file
   - Display a user-friendly error message when the file isn't found

5. Bonus - Reading a file line by line:
   - Open `input.txt` and read it line by line (not all at once)
   - Print each line with its line number
   - Use efficient file iteration techniques

6. Extra Challenge - Working with CSV data:
   - Create a simple CSV file with headers and several rows of data
   - Read the CSV file and process its structured content
   - Try both manual parsing and the `csv` module

## 🧪 Validation Checklist

✅ You've successfully read from `input.txt` using a `with` block  
✅ You've created and written to `output.txt` in write mode  
✅ You've appended additional content to `output.txt`  
✅ You've implemented error handling for file operations  
✅ You've processed a file line by line with line numbers  
✅ You've created and read a structured CSV file (bonus)  
✅ All file operations use the `with` statement for proper resource management  
✅ Your script runs without errors  

Run your script with:
```bash
python main.py
```

After running, check the contents of `output.txt` to verify your write and append operations worked correctly.

## 📚 File Handling Concepts

- **File Modes**:
  - **`'r'`**: Read mode (default) - for reading files
  - **`'w'`**: Write mode - creates new file or overwrites existing file
  - **`'a'`**: Append mode - adds to the end of an existing file
  - **`'r+'`**: Read/write mode - for both reading and writing
  - **`'b'`**: Binary mode (add to other modes, e.g., `'rb'`) - for non-text files

- **File Operations**:
  - **Opening**: `open(filename, mode)` - creates a file object
  - **Reading**: `file.read()`, `file.readline()`, `file.readlines()`
  - **Writing**: `file.write(string)`, `file.writelines(list_of_strings)`
  - **Closing**: `file.close()` (automatically called in `with` blocks)
  - **Position**: `file.tell()`, `file.seek(position)`

- **The `with` Statement**:
  - Automatically manages resources (closes files even if errors occur)
  - Recommended pattern for all file operations
  - Syntax: `with open(filename, mode) as file:`

- **Error Handling**:
  - `FileNotFoundError`: When opening a non-existent file in read mode
  - `PermissionError`: When lacking permissions for the operation
  - `IsADirectoryError`: When trying to open a directory as a file
  - `UnicodeDecodeError`: When reading a file with incorrect encoding

- **CSV Handling**:
  - Basic: Split lines by comma using `line.split(',')`
  - Advanced: Use the `csv` module for robust handling
  - `csv.reader()`, `csv.writer()` for row-based operations
  - `csv.DictReader()`, `csv.DictWriter()` for header-based operations

## 🚀 Extension Tasks

After completing the main tasks, try these additional challenges:
1. Read and write binary files (like images) using binary modes (`'rb'`, `'wb'`)
2. Use the `json` module to read and write JSON data
3. Create a function that counts words or specific patterns in a text file
4. Implement a simple log parser that extracts information from a log file
5. Create a file backup utility that copies files with a timestamp in the filename
6. Use the `pathlib` module for more modern file path handling
