# TODO: 1. Create variables of different types
# Create a string variable called 'name'

# Create an integer variable called 'age'

# Create a boolean variable called 'is_hungry'


# Create a list variable called 'skills' with at least 3 skills


# Create a dictionary variable called 'profile' that includes name, age, and skills


# TODO: 2. Print the variables using print()
# Print each variable with a descriptive label

# TODO: 3. Try basic operations
# Print your age in 5 years


# Print the number of skills you have


# Print your first skill from the list


# BONUS: Try additional operations if you finish early
# Try string methods like .upper() or .lower()

# Try adding a new skill to your list with .append()

# Try adding a new key-value pair to your dictionary


print("\nOnce you're done, run this file with: python main.py")
