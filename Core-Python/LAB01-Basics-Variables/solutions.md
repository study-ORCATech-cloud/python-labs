LAB01 - Python Basics: Variables and Data Types

Instructions:
1. Follow the comments below to create variables and print them
2. Run the script to see your results
3. Try experimenting with different values
"""

# TODO: 1. Create variables of different types
# Create a string variable called 'name'
name = "DevOps Learner"

# Create an integer variable called 'age'
age = 25

# Create a float variable called 'height'
height = 1.75

# Create a boolean variable called 'is_hungry'
is_hungry = True

# Create a list variable called 'skills' with at least 3 skills
skills = ["Python", "Git", "Linux"]

# Create a dictionary variable called 'profile' that includes name, age, and skills
profile = {
    "name": name,
    "age": age,
    "skills": skills
}

# TODO: 2. Print the variables using print()
# Print each variable with a descriptive label
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Hungry:", is_hungry)
print("Skills:", skills)
print("Profile Dictionary:", profile)

# TODO: 3. Try basic operations
# Print your age in 5 years
print("Age in 5 years:", age + 5)

# Print the number of skills you have
print("Number of skills:", len(skills))

# Print your first skill from the list
print("First skill:", skills[0])

# BONUS: Try additional operations if you finish early
# Try string methods like .upper() or .lower()
print("Name in uppercase:", name.upper())
print("Name in lowercase:", name.lower())

# Try adding a new skill to your list with .append()
skills.append("Docker")
print("Updated skills list:", skills)

# Try adding a new key-value pair to your dictionary
profile["height"] = height
print("Updated profile dictionary:", profile)

print("\nOnce you're done, run this file with: python main.py")
print("Check your output against the validation checklist in the README.md")
```

## Expected Output

When you run this script, you should see output similar to:

```
Name: DevOps Learner
Age: 25
Height: 1.75
Hungry: True
Skills: ['Python', 'Git', 'Linux']
Profile Dictionary: {'name': 'DevOps Learner', 'age': 25, 'skills': ['Python', 'Git', 'Linux']}
Age in 5 years: 30
Number of skills: 3
First skill: Python
Name in uppercase: DEVOPS LEARNER
Name in lowercase: devops learner
Updated skills list: ['Python', 'Git', 'Linux', 'Docker']
Updated profile dictionary: {'name': 'DevOps Learner', 'age': 25, 'skills': ['Python', 'Git', 'Linux', 'Docker'], 'height': 1.75}

Once you're done, run this file with: python main.py
Check your output against the validation checklist in the README.md
```

## Key Learning Points

1. **Variables and Assignment**:
   - In Python, you create variables by assigning values with the `=` operator
   - Variable names should be descriptive and follow snake_case convention
   - No need to declare variable types in advance (dynamic typing)

2. **Basic Data Types**:
   - `str` (strings): Text values enclosed in quotes - `"DevOps Learner"`
   - `int` (integers): Whole numbers - `25`
   - `float` (floating-point): Decimal numbers - `1.75`
   - `bool` (boolean): True/False values - `True`

3. **Collection Types**:
   - `list`: Ordered, mutable collections - `["Python", "Git", "Linux"]`
   - `dict` (dictionaries): Key-value pairs - `{"name": "DevOps Learner", "age": 25}`

4. **Basic Operations**:
   - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
   - String methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.capitalize()`, etc.
   - List operations: indexing with `[]`, `.append()`, `.pop()`, etc.
   - Dictionary operations: key access with `[]`, adding items with assignment

5. **The `print()` Function**:
   - Displays values to the console
   - Can take multiple arguments separated by commas
   - Good for debugging and visualizing variable values

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **String Concatenation**:
   - You can't directly concatenate strings and non-string types:
     - Incorrect: `print("Age: " + age)`
     - Correct: `print("Age:", age)` or `print(f"Age: {age}")`

2. **List Indexing**:
   - Python lists are zero-indexed (start at 0)
   - `skills[0]` gets the first item, not `skills[1]`
   - Trying to access an index out of range will raise an `IndexError`

3. **Dictionary Access**:
   - Accessing a key that doesn't exist raises a `KeyError`
   - Use `profile.get("key", default_value)` to safely access keys

4. **Variable Naming**:
   - Variable names can't start with numbers
   - Variable names are case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different)
   - Avoid using Python reserved keywords as variable names (e.g., `list`, `dict`, `print`)
