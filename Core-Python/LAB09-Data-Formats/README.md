# LAB09 - Working with Data Formats in Python

Data formats like JSON, YAML, and XML are the backbone of modern DevOps configuration and infrastructure. In this lab, you'll learn how to parse, manipulate, and generate these common data formats - essential skills for working with configuration files, APIs, and infrastructure as code.

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Work with JSON for configuration and data exchange
- Parse and generate YAML for infrastructure definitions
- Process XML data for legacy systems and APIs
- Validate data against schemas
- Transform between different data formats
- Handle common data format errors
- Apply best practices for working with configuration data

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Completion of LAB08 (Unit Testing Basics)
- Python 3.8+ installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Python dictionaries and file operations
- A code editor (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)
