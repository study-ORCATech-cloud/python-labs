# LAB12 - Asynchronous Programming

Modern DevOps automation often requires handling multiple operations concurrently. This lab teaches you asynchronous programming with Python's `asyncio` - essential for building high-performance monitoring tools, service orchestrators, and responsive automation systems.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand asynchronous programming concepts
- Use Python's `asyncio` library for concurrent operations
- Write code with async/await syntax
- Manage multiple concurrent tasks
- Handle errors in asynchronous code
- Work with asynchronous queues and events
- Implement timeouts and cancellations
- Apply best practices for async programming in DevOps contexts
- Measure and optimize async code performance

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Completion of LAB11 (CLI Development)
- Python 3.8+ installed on your system
- Solid understanding of Python functions and error handling
- A code editor (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)
