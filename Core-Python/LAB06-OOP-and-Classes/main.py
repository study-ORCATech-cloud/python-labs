LAB06 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This lab introduces you to object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
You'll create classes to model servers in a DevOps environment, implement
inheritance for specialized server types, and learn how OOP can make your
automation code more modular and maintainable.

Instructions:
1. Complete the code blocks below according to the TODOs
2. Run the script to see how objects interact
3. Extend the implementation with your own ideas
"""

# TODO: 1. Create a Server class
# Define a class called 'Server' with:
# - An __init__ method that takes 'name' and 'ip' parameters and stores them as attributes
# - A 'ping' method that prints a message showing the server is being pinged
#
# Example structure:
# class Server:
#     def __init__(self, name, ip):
#         # Your code here
#
#     def ping(self):
#         # Your code here


# TODO: 2. Instantiate a Server object
# Create an instance of your Server class with a name and IP address
# Call the ping method on your server instance
# Example:
# web_server = Server("web01", "192.168.1.10")
# web_server.ping()


# TODO: 3. Create a DatabaseServer class that inherits from Server
# Define a class that extends Server with:
# - An __init__ method that takes 'name', 'ip', and 'engine' parameters
# - A call to the parent class's __init__ method using super()
# - An 'engine' attribute to store the database engine type
# - A 'backup' method that prints a message about backing up the database
#
# Example structure:
# class DatabaseServer(Server):
#     def __init__(self, name, ip, engine):
#         # Your code here
#
#     def backup(self):
#         # Your code here


# TODO: 4. Instantiate a DatabaseServer object
# Create an instance of your DatabaseServer class with appropriate parameters
# Call both the ping method (inherited from Server) and the backup method
# Example:
# db_server = DatabaseServer("db01", "192.168.1.11", "PostgreSQL")
# db_server.ping()
# db_server.backup()


# TODO: 5. Add more advanced OOP concepts (Bonus)
# Try implementing some of these advanced concepts:
# - Add a class variable to Server (shared across all instances)
# - Create a static method for IP validation
# - Implement property getters and setters for a 'status' attribute
# - Override the ping method in DatabaseServer to customize its behavior
#
# Example structure for property:
# @property
# def status(self):
#     return self._status
#
# @status.setter
# def status(self, new_status):
#     # Add validation logic here


# TODO: 6. Extra Challenge: Create another derived class
# Create a WebServer class that also inherits from Server with:
# - Additional attributes like 'web_server_type' (e.g., "Nginx", "Apache")
# - Methods specific to web servers (deploy, restart, etc.)
# - Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a list of different server types
#   and calling common methods on them
#
# Example polymorphism:
# servers = [web_server, db_server, web_server2]
# for server in servers:
#     server.ping()  # Each server type will use its own implementation


# Display success message
