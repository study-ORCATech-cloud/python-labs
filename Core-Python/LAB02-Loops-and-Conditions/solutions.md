LAB02 - Python Basics: Loops and Conditional Logic

Instructions:
1. Complete each of the exercises below
2. Add your own code where indicated by the TODO comments
3. Run the script to test your implementations
"""

# TODO: 1. Conditional Statements
# Create a variable 'age' and write conditional logic to print 
# different messages based on the age value
# - If age is 18 or older: "You are an adult."
# - If age is between 13-17: "You are a teenager."
# - Otherwise: "You are a child."

age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")


# TODO: 2. Loop Over a List
# Create a list called 'skills' with at least 3 technology skills
# Use a for loop to iterate over the list and print each skill
# Example output: "Learning: Python"

skills = ["Python", "Bash", "Docker"]
for skill in skills:
    print("Learning:", skill)


# TODO: 3. Use a While Loop
# Create a counter variable
# Write a while loop that prints the counter value until it reaches 3
# Don't forget to increment the counter inside the loop!

counter = 0
while counter < 3:
    print("Counter is:", counter)
    counter += 1


# TODO: 4. Bonus: Loop with Conditional Logic
# Create a list of 'users' including at least "admin", "guest", and one other username
# Loop through the users and print a different greeting message for "admin" vs other users

users = ["admin", "guest", "devops"]
for user in users:
    if user == "admin":
        print("Welcome, administrator!")
    else:
        print(f"Hello, {user}!")


# TODO: 5. Extra Challenge: Nested Loops
# Create a small 2D structure (e.g., a 3x3 grid using a list of lists)
# Use nested loops to iterate through each element and print its position and value

grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

for row_index, row in enumerate(grid):
    for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
        print(f"Position ({row_index},{col_index}) contains: {value}")


print("\nGreat job! You've successfully worked with loops and conditionals.")
print("Run this script with: python main.py")
print("Check your implementation against the validation checklist in the README.md")
```

## Expected Output

When you run this script, you should see output similar to:

```
You are an adult.
Learning: Python
Learning: Bash
Learning: Docker
Counter is: 0
Counter is: 1
Counter is: 2
Welcome, administrator!
Hello, guest!
Hello, devops!
Position (0,0) contains: 1
Position (0,1) contains: 2
Position (0,2) contains: 3
Position (1,0) contains: 4
Position (1,1) contains: 5
Position (1,2) contains: 6
Position (2,0) contains: 7
Position (2,1) contains: 8
Position (2,2) contains: 9

Great job! You've successfully worked with loops and conditionals.
Run this script with: python main.py
Check your implementation against the validation checklist in the README.md
```

## Key Learning Points

1. **Conditional Logic**:
   - **`if` statements**: Execute code only if a condition is true
   - **`elif` statements**: Provide alternative conditions to check
   - **`else` statements**: Execute when no previous condition is met
   - Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
   - Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`

2. **For Loops**:
   - Iterate over elements in a sequence (like lists, strings, dictionaries)
   - Syntax: `for item in collection:`
   - Useful with `range()` function: `for i in range(5):`
   - Access both index and value with `enumerate()`: `for index, value in enumerate(collection):`

3. **While Loops**:
   - Continue execution as long as a condition remains true
   - Syntax: `while condition:`
   - Always ensure the condition will eventually become false (to avoid infinite loops)
   - Common patterns: counters, input validation loops, waiting loops

4. **Nested Loops**:
   - Placing one loop inside another loop
   - Useful for working with multi-dimensional data structures
   - Each iteration of the outer loop triggers a complete execution of the inner loop
   - Performance consideration: nested loops multiply the number of iterations

5. **Control Flow Keywords**:
   - `break`: Exit a loop immediately
   - `continue`: Skip to the next iteration
   - `pass`: Do nothing (placeholder)

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Infinite Loops**:
   - **Problem**: While loop never terminates because the condition is always true
   - **Solution**: Always ensure something inside the loop changes the condition to eventually become false
   - **Example**: Forgetting to increment a counter - `counter += 1`

2. **Indentation Errors**:
   - **Problem**: Python uses indentation to define code blocks; incorrect indentation causes errors
   - **Solution**: Use consistent indentation (4 spaces per level is standard)
   - **Example**: All code inside an `if` statement must be indented at the same level

3. **Off-by-One Errors**:
   - **Problem**: Loop runs one too many or one too few times
   - **Solution**: Double-check loop conditions, especially when using `<` vs `<=`
   - **Example**: `range(3)` gives `0, 1, 2` not `1, 2, 3`

4. **Condition Always True/False**:
   - **Problem**: Condition never changes state due to logic error
   - **Solution**: Verify your logical expressions, especially when using compound conditions
   - **Example**: Using assignment `=` instead of comparison `==` in a condition

5. **String vs. Integer Comparison**:
   - **Problem**: Comparing different data types can lead to unexpected results
   - **Solution**: Ensure variables are the expected type before comparison
   - **Example**: Comparing a string input `"18"` with numeric value `18` using `==`

## Advanced Techniques to Explore

1. **List Comprehensions**: Compact way to create lists based on existing lists
   ```python
   squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
   ```

2. **Conditional List Comprehensions**: Filtering items in a list comprehension
   ```python
   even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]  # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
   ```

3. **Ternary Conditional Operator**: Compact way to write simple if-else statements
   ```python
   status = "adult" if age >= 18 else "minor"
   ```

4. **Loop with `else` Clause**: Executes when loop completes normally (not via `break`)
   ```python
   for item in collection:
       if condition:
           break
   else:
       # This runs if the loop completes without a break
   ```
