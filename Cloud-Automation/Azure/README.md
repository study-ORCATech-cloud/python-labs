# Azure Python Automation Labs

Welcome to the **Azure Python Automation Labs** — a curated, hands-on lab series designed to teach you how to automate Microsoft Azure resources using Python.

These labs are part of the larger **Python for DevOps** learning path and are structured to take you from beginner-level cloud scripting to advanced automation and deployment practices.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

By completing these labs, you’ll gain practical experience in:
- Automating core Azure services such as VMs, storage, and networking
- Managing security and permissions via role-based access control (RBAC)
- Deploying serverless and containerized applications
- Monitoring and integrating Azure services for real-world DevOps workflows

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

To get started, you’ll need:
- An active Azure subscription
- Python 3.8+ installed on your system
- Azure CLI and credentials (service principal or CLI login)

Each lab includes:
- Step-by-step `README.md`
- Python scripts and supporting files
- Sample input data (where relevant)
- Cleanup instructions to avoid unnecessary charges
