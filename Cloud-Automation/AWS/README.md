# AWS Python Automation Labs

Welcome to the **AWS Python Automation Labs** — a hands-on collection of real-world labs focused on automating AWS services using Python and the `boto3` SDK. These labs are part of the broader **Python for DevOps** training path.

Each lab is designed to progressively teach you how to use Python to automate cloud operations, from launching EC2 instances to setting up serverless workflows and event-driven triggers.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

By completing these labs, you'll gain practical experience in:
- Automating compute, storage, and networking services
- Managing permissions and security policies
- Deploying serverless applications and event-based infrastructure
- Monitoring resources and responding to cloud events

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

To complete these labs, you should have:
- A valid AWS account
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic familiarity with Python scripting

Each lab includes:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Sample code using `boto3`
- Validation checklist
- Cleanup steps to avoid extra charges

## 🧠 Lab Progression

1. **Core Services**: EC2, S3, IAM
2. **Monitoring & Notifications**: CloudWatch, SNS
3. **Serverless & NoSQL**: Lambda, DynamoDB
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation
5. **Messaging & Events**: SQS, EventBridge

These labs follow a natural DevOps lifecycle and reinforce the principles of **Infrastructure as Code**, **automation**, and **cloud-native architecture**.

## 🌐 Lab Environment

- **AWS Region**: These labs use `eu-west-1` (Ireland) as the default region
- **Required Permissions**: Labs require appropriate IAM permissions
- **Cost Warning**: Some resources created may incur AWS charges if not deleted
