# LAB08 - VPC Network Creation - Solutions

This document provides solutions to the TODOs in the `create_vpc.py` script.

## Solution: Authenticate with Google Cloud

```python
def authenticate(credentials_file=None):
    """
    Authenticate with Google Cloud using service account credentials.
    """
    try:
        if credentials_file:
            # Use the provided service account file
            credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
                credentials_file,
                scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']

        raise Exception(f"Failed to find subnets for network: {e}")
```

## Running the Complete Solution

1. Set your GCP credentials:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your-service-account.json"
```

2. Create a new VPC network and subnet:
```bash
python create_vpc.py --project_id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --create --network_name custom-vpc --subnet_name custom-subnet
```

3. List all networks and subnets in your project:
```bash
python create_vpc.py --project_id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --list
```

4. Delete a network and its subnets:
```bash
python create_vpc.py --project_id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --delete --network_name custom-vpc
```

5. Create a network with a custom CIDR range:
```bash
python create_vpc.py --project_id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --create --network_name custom-vpc --subnet_name custom-subnet --ip_cidr_range 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Notes

When working with VPC networks in production environments:

1. Plan your IP address space carefully to avoid overlapping CIDRs
2. Use meaningful names that reflect the purpose of networks and subnets
3. Implement proper firewall rules to restrict traffic appropriately
4. Consider using private Google access for VM instances that don't need external IPs
5. Remember that VPC networks are global resources, but subnets are regional
