# GCP LAB08 - Automate VPC Network Creation with Python

In this lab, you'll learn how to automate the creation of a VPC network and subnet in Google Cloud using Python and the `google-api-python-client`. Private networks are essential for organizing cloud infrastructure securely and efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Create a custom VPC network programmatically
- Add a subnet with a specific IP CIDR range
- Configure firewall rules to control network traffic
- List existing networks and subnets in your project
- Implement proper resource cleanup to avoid orphaned networks

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- GCP project with billing enabled
- Compute Engine API enabled (enable with `gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com`)
- Service account with Compute Network Admin role (roles/compute.networkAdmin)
- Python 3.8+ installed

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set up your service account credentials:
```bash
# Create a service account (if you don't have one yet)
gcloud iam service-accounts create network-automation --display-name="Network Automation Account"

# Grant the required role
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:network-automation@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/compute.networkAdmin"

# Download credentials
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
    --iam-account=network-automation@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Point to your credentials file
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$(pwd)/key.json"
```

### 2. Navigate to the lab folder:
```bash
cd Cloud-Automation/GCP/LAB08-VPC-Network-Creation/
```

### 3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📝 Your Task

In this lab, you will complete the TODOs in the `create_vpc.py` script to:

1. Authenticate with Google Cloud using service account credentials
2. Build the Compute Engine API client
3. Create a custom VPC network with custom subnet mode
4. Create a subnet with a specific CIDR range
5. Configure a basic firewall rule to allow SSH access
6. List existing networks and subnets
7. Implement cleanup functionality to delete resources

The script already contains:
- Command-line argument parsing
- Error handling
- Helper functions for displaying network information

Your job is to fill in the missing implementation details marked with `TODO` comments.

### Running the Script

Once you've completed the TODOs, run the script with your GCP project ID:

```bash
# Create a new VPC network and subnet
python create_vpc.py --project_id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --create --network_name custom-vpc --subnet_name custom-subnet

# List existing networks and subnets
python create_vpc.py --project_id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --list

# Delete a network and its subnets (cleanup)
python create_vpc.py --project_id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --delete --network_name custom-vpc
```

## 🧪 Validation Checklist

Ensure your implementation:

✅ Successfully creates a custom VPC network  
✅ Creates a subnet with the specified CIDR range  
✅ Configures appropriate firewall rules  
✅ Lists networks and subnets correctly  
✅ Properly cleans up resources when requested  
✅ Handles errors gracefully with clear messages  

---

## 💡 Hints and Tips

- Use `autoCreateSubnetworks: False` to create a custom mode VPC network
- Remember that subnet CIDR ranges cannot overlap within the same network
- VPC networks exist at the global level, while subnets are regional resources
- When creating resources, check if they already exist to avoid errors
- Always delete resources in the right order: subnets before networks
- Use meaningful names for your networks and subnets to simplify management

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

Always clean up your resources to avoid unnecessary charges:

```bash
# Using your script
python create_vpc.py --project_id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --delete --network_name custom-vpc

# Or using gcloud (alternative)
gcloud compute networks subnets delete custom-subnet --region=us-central1
gcloud compute networks delete custom-vpc
```

VPC networks are the foundation of your cloud network architecture. Automating their creation ensures consistency, reduces errors, and enables infrastructure as code practices for your networking resources.
