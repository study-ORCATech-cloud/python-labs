# GCP Python Automation Labs

Welcome to the **GCP Python Automation Labs** — a hands-on, real-world lab series designed to teach you how to automate infrastructure and cloud operations on **Google Cloud Platform** using Python.

These labs are part of the broader **Python for DevOps** training program, focusing on cloud-native automation and scripting with real GCP APIs and SDKs.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

By completing these labs, you will gain practical skills in:
- Automating virtual machines, networks, databases, and cloud storage
- Deploying serverless and container-based applications
- Managing IAM roles and security
- Using Python to monitor, interact with, and control GCP services

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

To get started, you’ll need:
- A Google Cloud Platform project with billing enabled
- A service account key with appropriate roles for each lab
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) and Docker (for some labs)
