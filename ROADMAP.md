# Python Automation Labs ‚Äì Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the complete journey through the **Python Automation Labs**, covering development and automation topics across **core Python**, **cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)**, and **real-world DevOps scenarios**.

Each phase builds your skills incrementally, from Python scripting fundamentals to automating full infrastructure and deployments in the cloud.

## üîú Future Phases (Coming Soon)
- Linux Scripting and System Automation
- Docker Labs for Containerization
- CI/CD Pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps
- Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) Python-based automation
- Terraform Python automation with Pulumi

---

## üó∫ How to Use This Roadmap
- Begin with Core Python labs (PY01-PY12) to build fundamental skills
- Move to Automation Scripting (AUTO01-AUTO06) to apply Python to practical DevOps tasks
- Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) based on your needs and complete those labs
- Each lab builds on previous ones but can also be used independently
- Each lab contains both learning materials with TODOs and reference solutions

Happy coding, clouding, and automating! üß†üíª‚òÅÔ∏èüêç
