LAB06 - Task Scheduler Automation (Tasks Module)

This module contains the definitions of tasks that will be scheduled.
Each task is implemented as a function that performs a specific job.

These tasks will be imported and scheduled in scheduler.py.

# TODO: Import necessary modules
# You'll need datetime, time, and possibly other modules


# TODO: Implement a task logging function
# This function should:
# - Generate a timestamp
# - Print a formatted log message
# - Optionally write to a log file


# TODO: Define a system check task
# This function should:
# - Log the start of the check
# - Perform some simulated system check
# - Log the result


# TODO: Define a backup task
# This function should:
# - Log the start of the backup
# - Simulate a backup process
# - Log the completion


# TODO: Define a cleanup task
# This function should:
# - Log the start of cleanup
# - Simulate a cleanup process (e.g., removing old files)
# - Log the results


# TODO: BONUS - Define an advanced task
# Consider implementing something more complex like:
# - A task that reads/writes files
# - A task that makes an API call
# - A task that checks system resources


# This allows you to test the tasks directly
