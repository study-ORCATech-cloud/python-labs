# TODO: Define a function to read the log file
# The function should:
# - Open the log file
# - Read all lines
# - Return the content as a list of lines


# TODO: Define a function to analyze the logs
# The function should:
# - Count occurrences of different log levels (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)
# - Identify the time range of the logs (first and last timestamp)
# - Optionally: Extract specific types of events (e.g., failed logins, service errors)


# TODO: Define a function to generate a report
# The function should:
# - Create a new file called "report.txt"
# - Write a summary of the findings
# - Include counts, percentages, and notable events


# TODO: BONUS - Add more advanced analysis
# Some ideas:
# - Group errors by type or service
# - Detect patterns or trends (e.g., increasing error rates)
# - Calculate time between related events
# - Identify peak activity periods
