LAB04 - System Monitoring Scripts with Python

This script collects and displays real-time system metrics using the psutil library.
It provides an overview of CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

Usage:
    python monitor.py
"""

# TODO: Import the necessary libraries
# You'll need psutil for system metrics and time for the monitoring loop


# TODO: Define a function to collect system metrics
# The function should gather:
# - CPU usage percentage
# - Memory usage (used, available, percentage)
# - Disk usage (total, used, free, percentage)
# - Network I/O statistics (optional)


# TODO: Define a function to display the metrics in a readable format
# Consider using formatting to make the output clear and easy to read


# TODO: Implement a continuous monitoring loop (optional)
# This should:
# - Call your collection and display functions
# - Sleep for a specified interval
# - Allow for clean termination with Ctrl+C


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("System Monitoring Tool")
    print("=====================")
    
    # TODO: Implement your monitoring logic here
    # Options:
    # 1. Simple single measurement of system stats
    # 2. Continuous monitoring with a loop and interval
